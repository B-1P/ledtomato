## ESP32 Setup

Your ESP32 should expose the following HTTP endpoints:

- `GET /info` - Returns device information (should contain "led-tomato" or "pomodoro")
- `POST /led` - Accepts JSON payload for LED control

### LED Control API

The application sends JSON payloads to control the LED strip:

```json
{
  "mode": "progress",
  "progress": 0.5,
  "color": { "r": 255, "g": 0, "b": 0 },
  "litLeds": 15
}
```

Supported modes:
- `progress` - Show timer progress
- `flash` - Flash completion notification
- `off` - Turn off all LEDs

## Configuration

- **Work Duration**: 1-60 minutes (default: 25 minutes)
- **Break Duration**: 1-30 minutes (default: 5 minutes)
- **LED Count**: Automatically calculated based on strip length

## Architecture

- **PomodoroTimer**: Core timer logic and session management
- **EspDeviceManager**: Network discovery and HTTP communication
- **MainWindow**: UI controller and event handling
- **App**: Application lifecycle management
